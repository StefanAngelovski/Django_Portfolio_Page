        <h1>Really? A robot?</h1>
        <p>Yeah cool isn't it? It is a child's dream, so I thought about using my electronics knowledge to pull it off.
            In this project, I used an ESP32 to control the robot's movements remotely. The ESP32 is a microcontroller which
            is the brains of the operation, it handles bluetooth communication between the phone app (yeah made that too),
            as well as the robot itself. Effectively making it so you can control the hand from a distance. The robot was also published
            along with a research paper to an international organization called CIIT and presented at Hotel Sirius Strumica in 2024.
            You can read more about it below:

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1 x Sheet of Plywood: This readily available and inexpensive material provides a sturdy yet lightweight base for the robotic arm. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x ESPRESSIF ESP32 Devmodule: The brain of the operation, translating smartphone app commands into precise movements for the servo motors.  </p></li>
            <li><p>4 x Servo motors sg90: These compact units act as the arm's muscles, precisely rotating the joints based on commands. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x Battery Holder (3 cell): Provides power for both the servos and the ESP32 using standard AA batteries. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x Stable 5V Power Delivery: Ensures reliable servo operation using an Arduino Nano, a voltage step-up module, or a rechargeable Li-Ion battery (with charger). </p></li>
            <li><p>(Optional) 1 x 3.7V Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery: As an alternative to a battery holder this could be used with a Li-Ion battery charger module for infinite re-use. </p></li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Considerations</h1>
        <p>Firstly I was thinking about which material to use to build the frame out of. 3D printing could work but I didn't have access to a printer as they're very expensive,
            and even if I found one the plastic would cost allot. So I decided to go with plywood, my dad had a few sheets lying around so I used that. It is a cheap material,
            easy to work with, very sturdy and most importantly cheap.
        </p>
        <p>As for the electronics I was dead-set on an ESP32 because it contains much more memory than any Arduino which allows me to go wild with the bluetooth protocol and libraries.
            It also has a bluetooth module built-in. Isn't that amazing?
        </p>
        <p>
            The servos were a no-brainer, I had a few lying around from a previous project so I used those. They're cheap, easy to use, but had some issues with the SG90's pulling more current
            than the battery could provide. Additionaly they sometimes couldn't handle the weight of the arm so I had to use some tricks up my sleeve. Making the screws which the arm pivots around more
            loose. Also I effectively made a lever system (pivots around the front legs) so it can push the arm up allot more easily. In the future I plan to add metal gear servos with allot more torque.
        </p>
        <p>
            The battery holder I just had lying around, it would of-course be allot better to use a rechargable Li-Ion battery. However that would require upping the voltage to 5V from 3.7V with a step-up module.
            Also a potential upgrade in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was all first tested on a breadboard with potentiometers until later transfering to a solder PCB. Making the electronics allot more compact so you can put them under the robot base.
            The robot Bluetooth feature was later added after testing.
