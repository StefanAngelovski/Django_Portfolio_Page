        <h1>Really? A robot?</h1>
        <p>Yeah cool isn't it? It is a child's dream, so I thought about using my electronics knowledge to pull it off.
            In this project, I used an ESP32 to control the robot's movements remotely. The ESP32 is a microcontroller which
            is the brains of the operation, it handles bluetooth communication between the phone app (yeah made that too),
            as well as the robot itself. Effectively making it so you can control the hand from a distance. The robot was also published
            along with a research paper to an international organization called CIIT and presented at Hotel Sirius Strumica in 2024.
            You can read more about it below:

        <h1>How it was made</h1>

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1 x Sheet of Plywood: This readily available and inexpensive material provides a sturdy yet lightweight base for the robotic arm. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x ESPRESSIF ESP32 Devmodule: The brain of the operation, translating smartphone app commands into precise movements for the servo motors.  </p></li>
            <li><p>4 x Servo motors sg90: These compact units act as the arm's muscles, precisely rotating the joints based on commands. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x Battery Holder (3 cell): Provides power for both the servos and the ESP32 using standard AA batteries. </p></li>
            <li><p>1 x Stable 5V Power Delivery: Ensures reliable servo operation using an Arduino Nano, a voltage step-up module, or a rechargeable Li-Ion battery (with charger). </p></li>
            <li><p>(Optional) 1 x 3.7V Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery: As an alternative to a battery holder this could be used with a Li-Ion battery charger module for infinite re-use. </p></li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Considerations</h1>
        <p>Firstly I was thinking about which material to use to build the frame out of. 3D printing could work but I didn't have access to a printer as they're very expensive,
            and even if I found one the plastic would cost allot. So I decided to go with plywood, my dad had a few sheets lying around so I used that. It is a cheap material,
            easy to work with, very sturdy and most importantly cheap.
        </p>
        <p>As for the electronics I was dead-set on an ESP32 because it contains much more memory than any Arduino which allows me to go wild with the bluetooth protocol and libraries.
            It also has a bluetooth module built-in. Isn't that amazing?
        </p>
        <p>
            The servos were a no-brainer, I had a few lying around from a previous project so I used those. They're cheap, easy to use, but had some issues with the SG90's pulling more current
            than the battery could provide. Additionaly they sometimes couldn't handle the weight of the arm so I had to use some tricks up my sleeve. Making the screws which the arm pivots around more
            loose. Also I effectively made a lever system (pivots around the front legs) so it can push the arm up allot more easily. In the future I plan to add metal gear servos with allot more torque.
        </p>
        <p>
            The battery holder I just had lying around, it would of-course be allot better to use a rechargable Li-Ion battery. However that would require upping the voltage to 5V from 3.7V with a step-up module.
            Also a potential upgrade in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was all first tested on a breadboard with potentiometers until later transfering to a solderable prototyping board. Making the electronics allot more compact so you can put them inside the robot base.
            The robot Bluetooth feature was later added after testing.

        <h1>The Gripper</h1>
        <p>Building this robot required an end-effector to manipulate objects, the initial testing was done on a piece of cardboard until later moving on to the plywood.
            Essentialy the left and right side of the servo horns move in opposite directions, which means if we connect a wire coming from either one and then move the pivot
            of each of the servo 'fingers' it will move them to the same point in the middle where they touch. Stronger servo means more grip, a good locking servo can also help with it.</p>

        <h1>Movement</h1>
        <p>In consideration for this, I put myself to work in cutting all the necessary plywood pieces as I knew I needed the structural integrity.
            The plywood sheet was cut into separate rectangular wooden strips using a machine saw. After I brought them home I could further cut them into
            smaller chunks with a hand saw. The more complicated pieces like the gripper fingers and the shoulder were cut a little more precisely.
            A few drilled holes later I could connect each of the pieces with screws and nuts to act as pivot points. The more the nuts are tightened the more
            the arm can hold its position. The first servo was attached to the base (which was glued together with hot glue) moved the robot with horizontal rotation
            the second was at the side providing vertical movement and the third at the front leg allowing the robot to go back and forth. Effectively this allowed
            the robot to move in all 3 dimensions.

        <h1>Mobile app</h1>
        <p>I experimented with different ways of controlling the robot remotely, one of them was using a PS4 controller I borrowed. It wasn't particularly long-term
            and the libraries were very outdated, none seemed to work. So I decided to make my own app. I used MIT App Inventor, a block-based programming language which
            would speed up the process and allow me to focus on the bluetooth communication.</p>
        <p>The APP sends two integer digits to the ESP32, the first is the button number and the second is the boolean state. So whether on or off, 
            the Arduino code takes this as an input inside a switch-case and moves the servos accordingly.</p>
        <p>A video is provided as a demonstration, just note that some of the screws were loose in that demonstration if you can notice some wobble. This is easily fixed.</p>

        <h1>CIIT 2024</h1>
        <p>I was asked to join "The International Conference on Informatics and Information Technologies" which is series of conferences organized by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE).</p>
        <p>To join, I had to formulate a paper based on my Robotic Arm project which I later submitted with the mentorship of Vlatko Spasev from the same faculty. Quickly the team checked up on me and asked me
            to join their conference where I'd later present my project and receive questions from an international audience. Everything was paid for at Hotel Sirius in Strumica, there was even live music, good food
            and generally a jolly good time! Many presentations were held from AI, Robotics, Bioinformatics, Deep learning, Blockchain and so much more. You can see more on their site <a href="https://ciit.finki.ukim.mk/" target="_blank" style="color: cyan">here</a>.</p>
        <p>
            And also a link to the paper <a href="Robot_hand_CIIT_2024.pdf" download="Robot_Hand_CIIT_2024.pdf" style="color: cyan">here</a>.
