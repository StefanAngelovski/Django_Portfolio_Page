        <h1>Front end</h1>
        <p>I've been using Bootstrap 5 and it's helping with the speed of production of these sites.</p>
        <p>Additionaly Javascript was used to program some of the carousel features, the jumping from anchors without changing the url with a hashtag.
            The carousel as well as implementing a filter for the projects. The filter makes clones of the projects and then hides them based on the selection.
        </p>
        <h1>Features</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Neon Look: I was inspired by the retrowave style which inspires futurism. Which I believe describe my projects fairly well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Animated Buttons: I've added hover animations over some of the buttons, further emphasizing the style. The modals use a rotating rectangle with a gradient that
                    is cut inside of an inset property.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Colourful scrollbars: Cyan scrollbars, yo! Works on most browsers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Responsive: The site is responsive and will adapt to the screen size</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Owl Carousel: Projects need a way of not filling up all the screen space, this is one solution which is quite elegant.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
