        <h1>What is Ark?</h1>
        <p>Ark: Survival Evolved (stylized as ARK) is a 2015 action-adventure survival video game developed by Studio Wildcard. 
            In the game, players must survive being stranded on one of several maps filled with roaming dinosaurs, fictional fantasy monsters, 
            and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players.</p>
        <p>I was a founder of one of it's servers called Ark: Threadripper, containing many 'refugees' from the official dedicated servers from
            Studio Wildcard, I've spent many thousands of hours in this game and I do not regret a single second of it. I have made many friends
            and learned allot along the way. It has been a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games.
            Now since I had programming knowledge I thought I could make logging into the servers allot easier with a dedicated launcher so I sat down
            and made one using Visual Studio.
